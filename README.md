**Grades Analysis with NumPy**
This project provides a simple Python script that demonstrates how to analyze a list of grades using the NumPy library. 
The script calculates various statistics, sorts the grades, and filters high-performing students based on specific criteria.

**Prerequisites**
To run this code, you need Python installed with NumPy. If you haven't installed NumPy, you can install it via pip:
> pip install numpy

**Code Overview**
The following steps are included in this script:
> Importing NumPy: Import the numpy library to work with arrays and perform calculations.
> Creating the Grades Array: Define a list of grades, then convert it into a NumPy array.
> Calculating Statistics: Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the grades.
> Sorting and Finding Minimum/Maximum Grades: Sort the grades in ascending order and find the minimum and maximum grades.
> Finding the Index of the Highest Grade: Find the index of the highest grade in the array.
> Counting Grades Above 90: Count the number of students who scored above 90.
> Calculating the Percentage of Students Above 90: Calculate the percentage of students who scored above 90.
> Filtering High Performers: Create a new array called high_performers containing only grades above 90.
> Creating Passing Grades Array: Create another array passing_grades that contains all grades above 75.

**Running the Script**
> Save the script as grades_analysis.py.
> Run the script in the terminal or any Python IDE:

**Output**
Running the script will output the following information:

>The original grades array
>Mean, median, and standard deviation of the grades
>Maximum and minimum grades
>Sorted grades
>Index of the highest grade
>Count and percentage of grades above 90
>Lists of high performers and passing grades
